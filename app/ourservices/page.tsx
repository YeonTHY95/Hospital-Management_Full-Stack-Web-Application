                <p className='text-justify text-3xl'>Physiotherapy, also known as physical therapy, is a healthcare profession that focuses on restoring, maintaining, and maximizing physical function through various interventions, including exercise, manual therapy, and patient education. It helps to restore movement and function when someone is affected by injury, illness or disability. It can also help to reduce your risk of injury or illness in the future. It takes a holistic approach that involves the patient directly in their own care. Physiotherapists use a variety of techniques, including:
                Therapeutic exercises: To improve strength, flexibility, and coordination. </p>
                <br />
                <p className='text-justify text-3xl'>Manual therapy: Techniques like massage and mobilization to address soft tissue and joint problems. 
                Physical modalities: Using heat, cold, ultrasound, or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and inflammation. 
                Patient education and training: To help individuals understand their condition and learn how to manage it effectively. </p>

                <p id="acupuncture" className='text-5xl font-bold mb-[10px]'>Acupuncture</p>
                <p className='text-justify text-3xl'>Acupuncture, a core practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of energy (qi) and restore balance, potentially relieving pain and other health issues. It involves the insertion of very thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. A key component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is most commonly used to treat pain. Increasingly, it is being used for overall wellness, including stress management.</p><br />
                <p className='text-justify text-3xl'>Although acupuncture originated in TCM, its migration to the West was through other Asian countries, chiefly Korea and Japan. Many consider this a relatively recent movement; however, Osler himself mentioned acupuncture in his writings on medicine in the 1700s. However, acupuncture was considered for some time as a fringe treatment and not part of legitimate medical care. The efficacy of acupuncture is changing. Up to 1.5% of the US population has utilized acupuncture at some point, and the service is even available at many top academic medical centers in the United States. </p><br />
                <p className='text-justify text-3xl'>Acupuncture is seldom used as a sole treatment, however, but rather in conjunction or as an adjunct to traditional medical care. As more studies are done showing the efficacy of acupuncture to treat various types of pain, insurance companies are beginning to take notice. Acupuncture is now an in-office procedure covered by multiple insurance providers. Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness in the treatment of back pain, either acute or chronic, knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis, myofascial pain, and headaches. However, it must be noted that there is a significant placebo effect. There is power in belief. Many studies show not only acupuncture leading to superior pain relief for various ailments but also sham acupuncture. However, given the overall positive patient response, limited side effect profile, and little to no cost on the healthcare system, acupuncture is an essential alternative treatment modality</p>

                <p id="hydromassage" className='text-5xl font-bold mb-[10px]'>Hydromassage</p>
                <p className='text-justify text-3xl'>Hydromassage, or water massage, is a type of therapy in which a person uses water pressure to massage the skin. It is one of the techniques involved in hydrotherapy, which is popular at spas. Unlike a jacuzzi or whirlpool baths, which people tend to use for relaxation and pleasure, the purpose of hydromassage is therapeutic. During a session, jets apply water of varying temperatures and pressures to target different areas. There are different types of hydromassage. What happens during a session depends on the type a person chooses. Wet hydromassage involves sitting or lying in water while jets pump pressurized water toward specific areas of the body. A person can also opt for dry hydromassage, which does not involve getting wet.</p><br />
